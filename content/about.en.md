Hi!
It's me! Ali Shokoohi!
Such a happy web developer!

I started programming with Python language.
After a few months, I started developing the websites with the Django framework.

I'm developing websites since 2017.

For developing the Back-End of the websites I'm programming with the Go language right now.

The technologies I use:

- Optimized web application performance with in-memory caching using Redis
- Develop custom authentication system for users with JWT and OAuth2
- Designed API schema and build back-end
- Designed and architect the database schema with the PostgreSQL
- Working with design patterns such as Factory, Facade, Singleton and etc ...
- Utilized deploy and DevOps skills to deploy applications on a server
  with cloud environments.
